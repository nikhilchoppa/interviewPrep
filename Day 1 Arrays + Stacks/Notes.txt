Data Structures-> Linear and Non-Linear
Linear: Arrays, LinkedList, Stack, Queue
Nonlinear: Tree, Graphs

Algorithm is a set of instructions, which we use to perform a task or to solve a given problem.

there are several different algorithms to solve a given problem
Analysis of Algorithm deals in finding best algorithm which runs fast and takes in less memory

Static Array(fixed size arrays)

proprties of array
An array is contiguous block of data, it will store in RAM in same way
two most Common operations of array is reading/writing the data
reading the data from an index position (O(1)) (instant operation/constant time)
Writing and removing operations at any random location (O(1)) 
Operation        Big-O Time
r/wi-th element => O(1)
Insert / Remove End => 0(1)
Insert Middle => 0(n)
Remove Middle => 0(n)
